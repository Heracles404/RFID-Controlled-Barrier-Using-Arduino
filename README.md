# RFID-Controlled-Barrier-Using-Arduino
## Objective: Integrate software, sensors, and hardware for a controlled RFID gate or barrier system.
## Demonstration (Youtube): https://youtu.be/ZaOVl-oycdk

### Components:
PC to Arduino (Software): C# forms for manual gate control. C# forms for manual light operation. Disable/lock gate (RFID) mechanisms.

### Arduino to PC (Sensor):
Gate status updates (up/down or open/close). RFID validation.
LEDs / lights status (ON or OFF).

### PC to Arduino:
Manual gate / barrier control.
Manual LEDs / light control. 

### Hardware:
Basic manual gate control using switches. 
RGB indicators (GO - Green or STOP - Red) for visual feedback.
LEDs to act like street lights.
